        title1: "Our Inspiration: From Raccoons to Chaos Champions",
        beginning:"At Petty Store, our roots run deep in a love for animals and a spirit that's part raccoon—chaotic, friendly, and always ready to entertain. Inspired by the mischievous charm of our spirit animal, we set out to create a pet store like no other. Our mission? To inject a dose of dark humor, sass, and edge into the pet care industry, offering an authentic and relatable experience that celebrates the quirks of pet ownership. Because why settle for boring when you can embrace the chaos and charm of life with pets? Welcome to Petty Store, where raccoons aren't just in our hearts—they're our guiding philosophy.",
        title2: "Community Commitment: Paw-sitive Impact Beyond Our Doors",
        community: "At Petty Store, we're not just about selling pet products—we're committed to making a paw-sitive impact in our local community. Through our strong veterinary connections, we offer our customers a 10% discount on vet costs, ensuring their furry family members receive top-notch care without breaking the bank. We also proudly support our local animal shelter with monthly donations, because every pet deserves a loving home and a comfy bed. Our team members have the opportunity to give back, with an optional paid day each month dedicated to helping local animal shelters, veterinarians, and farmers. It's our way of ensuring that the love we have for pets extends beyond our store, enriching the lives of animals and humans alike in our community.",
